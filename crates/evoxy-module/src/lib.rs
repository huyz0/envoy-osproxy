//! The Envoy dynamic-module cdylib (ADR-004).
//!
//! Two layers:
//! - a **driver** ([`Module`]) that is pure Rust over [`evoxy-filter`] — it holds
//!   the [`Filter`] brain and a Tokio runtime handle, and runs one request. This
//!   builds and is reviewable anywhere (no SDK, no libclang).
//! - the **SDK binding** (the `sdk` module, behind `--features sdk`): implements
//!   the Envoy SDK's filter trait, adapts each callback to
//!   [`evoxy_filter::EnvoyActions`], and registers the module. Host-gated.
//!
//! The whole point of the split (ADR-004) is that everything the driver does is
//! exercised by `evoxy-filter`'s tests; the SDK layer is a thin, mechanical
//! adapter with no business logic.

// SDK: the real Envoy ABI binding lives here, behind `--features sdk`, and is the
// only host-gated code (needs libclang + the Envoy SDK). It (1) implements
// `EnvoyActions` over the SDK's request handle — `set_method`/`set_path` on the
// request headers, replacing the body buffer, header set/remove, `send_local_reply`,
// and selecting the upstream cluster; and (2) implements the SDK's HTTP-filter
// trait by buffering headers+body into a `FilterRequest`, calling `Module::on_request`,
// and translating `FilterDecision` into the SDK's continue/stop status; and (3)
// invokes the SDK registration macro with the `register!` factory. See README.md.
